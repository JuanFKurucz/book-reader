## Project Structure

Book Reader follows a modern Python package structure with clear separation of concerns:

```
book-reader/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                # Source code
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/               # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/              # Test suite
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ integration/    # End-to-end tests with real API calls
â””â”€â”€ ...                 # Configuration files
```

For more details about the architecture and components, see the [API documentation](https://juanfkurucz.github.io/book-reader/api/).

## Testing

Book Reader includes both unit tests and integration tests:

### Unit Tests

Run the unit tests with:

```bash
# Using pytest directly
pytest

# Or with uv
uv run pytest
```

### Integration Tests

The project includes end-to-end integration tests that perform real API calls to OpenAI. These tests:
- Require an OpenAI API key (from environment variable or .env file)
- Consume API credits
- Are skipped by default in normal test runs

To run integration tests:

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key (if not in .env file)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Run all integration tests using uv
uv run pytest tests/integration/

# Run specific integration test file
uv run pytest tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py

# Run integration tests with sample generation
uv run pytest tests/integration/create_samples.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest -v tests/integration/

# Run with coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=book_reader tests/integration/
```

Note: Integration tests may take longer to run as they interact with external services. Make sure you have sufficient API credits before running them.

For more details, see [Integration Tests README](tests/integration/README.md).
